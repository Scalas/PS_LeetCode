Example 1:

Input: s = "abaacbcbb"

Output: 5

Explanation:
We do the following operations:

Choose index 2, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 3. The resulting string is s = "bacbcbb".
Choose index 3, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 5. The resulting string is s = "acbcb".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa"

Output: 2

Explanation:
We cannot perform any operations, so we return the length of the original string.
