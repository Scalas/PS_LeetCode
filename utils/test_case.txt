Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,1,2,6], queries = [[0,4]]

Output: [false]

Explanation:

The subarray is [3,4,1,2,6]. 2 and 6 are both even.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,3,1,6], queries = [[0,2],[2,3]]

Output: [false,true]

Explanation:

The subarray is [4,3,1]. 3 and 1 are both odd. So the answer to this query is false.
The subarray is [1,6]. There is only one pair: (1,6) and it contains numbers with different parity. So the answer to this query is true.
